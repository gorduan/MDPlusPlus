/**
 * MD++ Plugin Themes Index
 *
 * This module contains plugin-specific color tokens and styles.
 * Each plugin can define its own colors that integrate with the
 * core theme system (light-dark() compatible).
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Each plugin has its own theme file
 * - Plugin tokens extend semantic tokens from _colors.scss
 * - Plugins can override default colors for customization
 *
 * Based on:
 * - https://milkdown.dev/ (Plugin-driven framework)
 * - https://github.com/tokiforge/tokiforge (Runtime theming)
